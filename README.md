# Sample E-Commerce application using Microservices / Cloud Native Architecture (CNA)
**_A fictitious e-commerce sample application built using modern technologies and  Microservices & Cloud Native Architecture patterns._**
- **Polyglot Languages & Frameworks** (Java - Spring Boot/Cloud, Python - FastAPI, SQLAlachamey, JavaScript/TypeScript - Node, ExpressJS, React)
- **Polyglot Databases** (MongoDB, Redis, ElastiSearch, PostgreSQL)
- Able to deploy to **local Kubernetes (k8s) cluster** as containers (Docker) and also to **Public Cloud (AWS)**.

This is an end-to-end **e-commerce solution** that demonstrates how to build a moder CNA application using microservices architecture with full-stack technologies. This application includes below functional microservices which are independently deployable with bounded context.
